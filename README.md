# Simon-Game

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game. The game requires players to memorize and repeat a series of colors and sounds generated by the game.

## Getting Started

To play the Simon game, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Press any key to start the game.
4. Watch and listen as the game presents a sequence of colors.
5. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the buttons in the correct order.
6. If you make a mistake, the game will end and display a "Game Over" message.
7. Press any key to restart the game and try again.

## How It Works

The game uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and implement the game logic.

The `index.html` file contains the structure of the game's interface, including buttons for each color and a level title. The interface is styled using the `styles.css` file, which defines the colors, layout, and animations.

The game's logic is implemented in the `game.js` file. It uses JavaScript and jQuery to handle user input, generate random sequences of colors, play sounds, and check if the user's input matches the generated sequence.

## Customization

If you want to modify the game or customize it further, you can make the following changes:

- **Adding more colors**: You can modify the `buttonColours` array in `game.js` to include additional colors. Make sure to define the corresponding CSS classes in `styles.css`.
- **Changing game difficulty**: You can adjust the difficulty of the game by modifying the game's behavior. For example, you can change the speed at which colors are presented or increase the length of the sequences.
- **Modifying visuals**: You can customize the appearance of the game by modifying the CSS styles in `styles.css`. Feel free to experiment with different colors, animations, or layouts to suit your preferences.

## What I Learned

While creating this Simon game, I gained knowledge and experience in the following areas:

- **JavaScript and jQuery**: I learned how to use JavaScript and jQuery to manipulate the game's interface, handle user input, generate random sequences, and implement game logic.
- **DOM manipulation**: I learned how to dynamically update the HTML elements on the page, such as changing the level title or animating button presses.
- **Event handling**: I learned how to listen for user events, such as keypresses and button clicks, and trigger appropriate actions in response.
- **CSS styling**: I learned how to use CSS to style the game's interface, including colors, borders, animations, and transitions.
- **Array manipulation**: I learned how to work with arrays to store and manipulate game patterns, as well as compare the user's input with the generated sequence.
- **Game development principles**: I gained insights into the fundamental concepts of game development, such as generating random sequences, checking user input, and implementing game over and restart functionality.

## Next Steps

- **High Scores**: Implement a system to keep track of players' high scores and display them.
- **Timed Mode**: Add a timed mode where players must complete each level within a certain time limit.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Enable multiplayer functionality, allowing players to compete against each other.
- **Sound Options**: Allow players to adjust sound settings or add different sound effects for each color.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Optimize the game for mobile devices and touchscreen interactions.
